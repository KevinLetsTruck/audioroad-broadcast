## üéôÔ∏è Part 2: Generate Social Content from Shows

### After Each Show:

**Step 1: Get Episode ID**

Find your episode ID:
- In database (Prisma Studio)
- Or from UI (we'll add this to dashboard)
- Looks like: `clxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

---

**Step 2: Analyze Show**

```bash
curl -X POST https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app/api/content/analyze/YOUR_EPISODE_ID
```

**Returns:** List of calls scored 0-100 for social potential

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "recommended": 8,
  "calls": [
    {
      "callId": "call_123",
      "score": 92,
      "contentType": "educational",
      "platforms": ["Instagram", "TikTok"],
      "topics": ["fuel savings", "MPG tips"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

**Step 3: Generate Social Content**

```bash
curl -X POST https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app/api/content/generate/YOUR_EPISODE_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"limit": 8}'
```

**Takes 10-15 minutes** (AI is analyzing and generating captions)

**Creates:**
- 8 clip records in database
- AI captions for each platform
- Hashtags for each clip
- Platform recommendations

---

**Step 4: View Generated Content**

```bash
curl https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app/api/content/pending
```

**Returns:** All clips with AI-generated captions awaiting your review

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "clips": [
    {
      "id": "clip_123",
      "title": "Fuel-Saving Hack",
      "aiCaption": "üí° Fuel-Saving Hack from an OTR Driver!...",
      "aiHashtags": ["#Trucking", "#FuelSavings", ...],
      "aiSuggestions": {
        "instagram": "caption for IG",
        "facebook": "caption for FB",
        "youtube": "title for YT",
        "tiktok": "caption for TikTok"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Each clip has platform-specific captions ready to use!**

---

**Step 5: Use the Captions**

Copy the captions and post manually (for now):

1. Copy Instagram caption
2. Go to Instagram
3. Upload video
4. Paste caption
5. Add hashtags
6. Post!

Repeat for Facebook, YouTube, TikTok

**Takes 5-10 minutes per clip** (vs. hours to create from scratch!)
