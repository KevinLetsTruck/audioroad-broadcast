## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### SMS not appearing in chat?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Is a show currently LIVE? (SMS only works during broadcast)
2. ✅ Is Twilio webhook configured correctly?
3. ✅ Check Railway logs for errors
4. ✅ Verify WebSocket connection is active

**View logs in Railway:**
- Look for: `📱 SMS received from...`
- Look for: `✅ Chat message created from SMS`

### Can't reply to SMS?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Is `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` set in Railway environment variables?
2. ✅ Check Railway logs for: `❌ Error sending SMS reply`
3. ✅ Verify Twilio account has SMS credits

### Auto-reply when show is offline?

**Expected behavior:**
- When no show is live, team receives:
  ```
  "No show currently broadcasting. Check schedule at audioroad.com"
  ```
- This prevents confusion about why you're not responding
