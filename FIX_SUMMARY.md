# AudioRoad Broadcast - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Call Now Button Stuck on "Loading..."

**Problem:** 
- The "Call Now" button was permanently stuck showing "‚è≥ Loading..."
- Twilio Device initialization was failing with `AccessTokenInvalid` errors
- The button never became clickable because `isReady` state stayed `false`

**Root Cause:**
- Twilio credentials in `.env` appear to be test/demo credentials
- Device initialization errors were preventing the `isReady` state from being set

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `/src/hooks/useTwilioCall.ts`:
  - Added better error handling for token fetch failures
  - Changed behavior to set `isReady = true` even when errors occur
  - This prevents the button from being permanently stuck
  - Now shows clearer error messages in console when Twilio fails

**Result:** 
- Button will no longer be stuck in loading state
- User will be able to click it, and will get a clear error message if Twilio is not configured
- Console will show detailed error about what's wrong with Twilio setup

### 2. ‚úÖ File Upload Not Showing Uploaded Files

**Problem:**
- Files could be selected and uploaded
- Upload appeared to work from client side
- But files weren't displaying in the "Uploaded Documents" section
- Console showed 500 errors from `/api/analysis/document` endpoint

**Root Cause:**
- AWS S3 credentials were set to `not_configured_yet` in `.env`
- The upload endpoint tried to call `uploadToS3()` which failed
- This caused the entire document creation to fail with 500 error
- No document record was saved to database

**Fix Applied:**
- Modified `/server/routes/analysis.ts`:
  - Added check for AWS credentials before attempting S3 upload
  - If AWS not configured, uses placeholder URL: `file://local/[filename]`
  - Allows the upload to proceed without S3 for MVP testing
  - Document record is still saved to database
  - AI analysis still runs (using mock AI for now)
  - Better error messages with stack traces

**Result:**
- File uploads now work even without AWS S3 configured
- Uploaded files will display in the "Uploaded Documents" section
- When you configure real AWS credentials, S3 upload will work automatically

## What You Need to Do Next

### For Full Twilio Functionality:
The current Twilio credentials appear to be test/demo credentials. To get calling working:

1. Log in to your Twilio account
2. Get your real credentials:
   - Account SID (starts with `AC`)
   - Auth Token
   - API Key (starts with `SK`)
   - API Secret
   - TwiML App SID (starts with `AP`)
   - Phone Number

3. Update `.env` file in audioroad-broadcast directory with real values

4. Restart the server

### For Full File Storage (S3):
Currently using placeholder URLs for uploaded files. To enable real S3 storage:

1. Set up an AWS S3 bucket
2. Create IAM credentials with S3 access
3. Update `.env`:
   ```
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_real_key_here
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_real_secret_here
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=audioroad-recordings
   ```
4. Restart the server

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Call Button
1. Refresh the page at https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app
2. Go to the "Call Now" page
3. The button should NO LONGER show "‚è≥ Loading..."
4. It should show either:
   - "üìû Call Now" if show is live
   - "‚ö´ Show Offline" if show is not live
5. Click the button - you'll get a proper error message if Twilio isn't configured

### Test 2: File Upload
1. Go to the "Call Now" page
2. Click "Browse Files" or drag a file into the upload area
3. Select a PDF, JPG, or PNG file
4. Click "Upload"

6. It will show:
   - File name
   - Document type
   - Upload time
   - "ü§ñ Analyzing..." or "‚úì Analyzed" status
