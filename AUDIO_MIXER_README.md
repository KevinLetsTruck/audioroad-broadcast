## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Individual Volume Control

This is the **main feature** you requested. Here's how it works:

**Before (Audio Hijack)**:
```
All audio mixed → One output → Radio.co
```

**Now (Built-in Mixer)**:
```
Host Mic (80%) ────┐
Caller 1 (75%) ────┤
Caller 2 (90%) ────┼──→ Master Mix ──→ Radio.co
Soundboard (65%) ──┤                 └──→ Recording
Files (70%) ───────┘
```

**Each source has its own slider!** This means:
- Lower one caller without affecting others
- Boost quiet person independently
- Mute anyone instantly
- Professional broadcast control

### Real-Time VU Meters

Every channel shows a **visual level meter**:
- **Green** = Good level, no distortion
- **Yellow** = Getting loud, still okay
- **Red** = Too loud! Turn it down!

The meters update **60 times per second** for instant feedback.

### Master Output Section

At the bottom of the mixer:
- **Master Volume** - Controls everything (usually keep at 100%)
- **Master VU Meter** - Shows final output level
- **Record Button** - One-click recording
- **Go Live Button** - Stream to Radio.co

## 🎨 Using Individual Volume Control

### Scenario 1: Quiet Caller
```
Problem: Caller is too quiet
Solution: Raise ONLY their slider to 90%

❌ Wrong: Raising master (affects everyone)
✅ Right: Raise caller's individual slider
```

### Scenario 2: Loud Caller
```
Problem: Caller is too loud
Solution: Lower ONLY their slider to 60%

❌ Wrong: Lowering master (affects everyone)
✅ Right: Lower caller's individual slider
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Callers
```
You have:
- Host: 80% (you sound good)
- Caller 1: 75% (perfect level)
- Caller 2: 90% (too loud)
- Caller 3: 60% (too quiet)

Solution:
- Leave host and caller 1 alone
- Lower caller 2 to 75%
- Raise caller 3 to 75%
- Keep master at 100%

Result: Everyone balanced!
```

## 🔧 How It Works Technically

### The Magic: GainNodes

Every audio source gets its own **GainNode** in the Web Audio API:

```typescript
// Simplified version of what happens inside
const hostMicGain = audioContext.createGain();
hostMicGain.gain.value = 0.80; // 80%

const caller1Gain = audioContext.createGain();
caller1Gain.gain.value = 0.75; // 75%

const caller2Gain = audioContext.createGain();
caller2Gain.gain.value = 0.90; // 90%

// All connect to master
hostMicGain.connect(masterMix);
caller1Gain.connect(masterMix);
caller2Gain.connect(masterMix);
```

When you move a slider, it updates **that source's GainNode only**!

## 🎓 For Learning

Since you mentioned you have no coding experience, here's what each part does:

### `audioMixerEngine.ts`
**What it does**: Like a sound mixing board's brain  
**How**: Uses your browser's built-in audio processing  
**You control it**: Through the sliders and buttons in the UI

### `BroadcastMixer.tsx`
**What it does**: The visual mixer interface you see  
**How**: React components (like building blocks)  
**You interact with**: Sliders, buttons, meters

### `VUMeter.tsx`
**What it does**: The green/yellow/red level meters  
**How**: Draws on a canvas in real-time  
**You see**: Visual feedback of audio levels

### `streamEncoder.ts`
**What it does**: Converts audio to MP3 for Radio.co  
**How**: Uses lamejs library  
**You use it**: When clicking "Go Live"

## 🆘 Getting Help

### If the mixer won't start:
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Make sure you're using Chrome
3. Grant microphone permissions
4. Refresh and try again

### If you can't hear audio:
1. Check if source is muted (red button)
2. Check if volume is at 0%
3. Check browser's audio output
4. Restart the mixer

### If callers don't appear:
1. Make sure mixer is initialized
2. Check if call is actually connected
3. See `MIXER_CALLER_INTEGRATION.md`

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always use headphones** when broadcasting (prevents feedback)
2. **Start with everything at 75%** and adjust from there
3. **Watch the VU meters** - green is your target
4. **Record a test** before going live
5. **Keep master at 100%** - adjust individual sources instead
