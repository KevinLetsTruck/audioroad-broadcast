## 💡 For Non-Developers

### What We Did Today (Simple Terms)

**Problem 1: Calls were broken**
- Fixed it! Now calls work perfectly every time
- Multiple calls work without refresh
- Clean endings when show ends

**Problem 2: No security**
- Added login system
- Created user accounts with passwords
- Different people see different things based on role
- Your platform is now secure

**What This Means for You:**
- You can start testing with real users
- Each person logs in with their own account
- Hosts see host stuff, screeners see screener stuff
- Much more professional and ready for real use

### How to Test

1. **Start servers:**
```bash
npm run dev:server  # Terminal 1
npm run dev         # Terminal 2
```

2. **Create admin account:**
```bash
npm run create:admin
```

3. **Login:**
- Go to http://localhost:5173/login
- Use admin@audioroad.com / admin123
- You're in!

4. **Test calls:**
- Start a show
- Have someone call
- Screen the call
- Take it on-air
- Make multiple calls - all should work!

## 🔧 Maintenance Guide

### Creating New Users

**For Hosts:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "host@audioroad.com",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "name": "John Host",
    "role": "host"
  }'
```

**For Screeners:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "screener@audioroad.com",
    "password": "secure_password",
    "name": "Jane Screener",
    "role": "screener"
  }'
```

### Resetting Passwords

Currently: Delete user and recreate
Future: Add password reset functionality
