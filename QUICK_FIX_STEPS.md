# Quick Fix Steps - Try This NOW

## Step 1: Fix TwiML App URL

**Go to Twilio Console** â†’ TwiML Apps â†’ AudioRoad Broadcast

**Change the Voice Request URL from:**
```
https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app/api/twilio/voice?v=
```

**To (remove the ?v= parameter):**
```
https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app/api/twilio/voice
```

**Save it**

## Step 2: Test Immediately

1. **Wait 1 minute** for Twilio to propagate
2. **Go to Call Now page**
3. **Open Console (F12)** - clear it
4. **Click "ðŸ“ž Call Now"**
5. **Tell me:**
   - Do you hear the greeting?
   - Does timer advance?
   - What logs appear in console?

---

## Why This Might Fix It:

The `?v=` parameter was meant to force Twilio to refresh its cache, but it might be:
- Breaking the endpoint routing
- Causing Express to not match the route
- Confusing the TwiML response

Removing it should make Twilio call the clean `/api/twilio/voice` endpoint.

## If This Doesn't Work:

I'll create a completely fresh endpoint with a different name to bypass any caching issues.
