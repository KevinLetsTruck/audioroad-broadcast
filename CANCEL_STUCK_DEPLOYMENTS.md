# üõë How to Cancel Stuck Railway Deployments

**If deployments are stuck, follow these steps to clear them out:**

---

## Step 1: Cancel All Stuck Deployments

In your Railway dashboard (the screenshot you showed):

### For EACH stuck deployment:

1. Find the deployment that says "INITIALIZING" 
2. On the RIGHT side of that deployment, click the **three dots menu (‚ãÆ)**
3. Click **"Cancel Deployment"**

**Do this for all the stuck deployments:**
- "Fix Railway deployment loop: Add prisma migrate de..." (10 minutes ago)
- "Add production ready summary and beta testing do..." (13 minutes ago)  
- "Add comprehensive beta testing guide for tomorrow" (14 minutes ago)

**Leave the newest one:**
- "Simplify Railway config..." (this just got created)

---

## Step 2: Wait for the New Deployment

After cancelling the old ones, the newest deployment should start processing:

**Watch for:**
- Status changes from "INITIALIZING" to "BUILDING"
- Timer starts counting up
- Progress messages change

---

## Step 3: If It's STILL Stuck...

If even after cancelling the old deployments, the new one is stuck on "Taking a snapshot..." for more than 5 minutes, try this:

### Option A: Restart the Service

1. In Railway, click on **your service** (audioroad-broadcast)
2. Go to **Settings** (top right)
3. Scroll down to **"Danger Zone"**
4. Click **"Restart Service"**
5. Watch for a new deployment to start

### Option B: Check Railway Status

Sometimes Railway itself has issues:

1. Go to: https://status.railway.app
2. Check if there are any ongoing incidents
3. If yes, you just need to wait for Railway to fix it

### Option C: Disconnect and Reconnect GitHub

1. In Railway Settings
2. Find **"Source Repo"** section
3. Click **"Disconnect"**
4. Click **"Connect Repo"** 
5. Select your `audioroad-broadcast` repo again
6. This will trigger a fresh deployment

---

## Step 4: Check Environment Variables

While waiting, verify your environment variables are set:

1. Click **"Variables"** tab in Railway
2. Make sure you have:
   - ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` (should be auto-set if you have Postgres addon)
   - ‚úÖ `NODE_ENV=production`
   - ‚úÖ All your Twilio variables
   - ‚úÖ `GEMINI_API_KEY`

---

## What Changed in the New Deployment

I simplified the configuration to remove potential conflicts:

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå `Procfile` (was conflicting)
- ‚ùå `nixpacks.toml` (was conflicting)
- ‚ùå `start.sh` (not needed)

**Kept:**
- ‚úÖ `railway.json` (simplified, all-in-one config)
- ‚úÖ `.nvmrc` (Node version lock)

**New railway.json:**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm ci && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx prisma migrate deploy && node dist/server/index.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health"
  }
}
```

This is the simplest, most direct configuration possible.

---

## Expected Behavior Now

**Build Phase:**
```
1. npm ci (install dependencies)
2. npm run build (compile everything)
```

**Deploy Phase:**
```
1. npx prisma migrate deploy (run migrations)
2. node dist/server/index.js (start server)
3. Railway checks /api/health
4. Deployment goes ACTIVE ‚úÖ
```

---

## If Nothing Works...

### Nuclear Option: Delete and Recreate the Service

If Railway is completely stuck:

1. **Export your environment variables** (copy them to a text file)
2. In Railway Settings ‚Üí Delete Service
3. Create a NEW service
4. Connect to your GitHub repo
5. Add Postgres addon
6. Re-add all environment variables
7. Deploy

This gives you a completely fresh start.

**Try cancelling the stuck deployments first and see if the new one starts building!**
