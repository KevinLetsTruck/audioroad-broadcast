# Integration Status - End of Session

## What We've Built Today

‚úÖ **Complete audio mixer system** (replaces Audio Hijack)  
‚úÖ **One-button broadcast workflow**  
‚úÖ **Smart show selection** (5 weekly shows)  
‚úÖ **Recordings management**  
‚úÖ **React Router** (proper URLs)  
‚úÖ **Settings persistence** (password saves)  
‚è≥ **Global call management** (in progress - 40% complete)  

## Current State

### What Works ‚úÖ
- Mixer initializes and connects microphone
- Recording downloads locally
- Show selection and auto-detection
- Episode creation
- Proper URLs (/, /host-dashboard, etc.)
- Settings save in localStorage

### What's In Progress ‚è≥
- **Volume controls** - Sliders move but don't affect audio yet
- **Call persistence** - Calls disconnect when navigating
- **Twilio integration** - Multiple devices conflicting

##What Needs to Finish (Next Session)

### Phase 3: Update Screening Room
- Remove local useTwilioCall hook
- Use broadcast.twilioDevice (global)
- Use broadcast.connectToCall() for screener calls

### Phase 4: Update CallNow Page
- Remove local useTwilioCall hook  
- Use global device (if needed)

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- Test complete workflow
- Fix remaining bugs
- Verify volume controls work
- Test navigation doesn't disconnect

## Known Issues

1. **Timer stuck at 00:00:00** - Duration counter not updating (fix in progress)
2. **Mic shows disconnected** - Status indicator wrong (mixer is connected)
3. **Volume sliders don't affect audio** - Not routed through mixer yet
4. **Navigation disconnects calls** - Multiple Twilio devices interfering
5. **Calls drop randomly** - Device conflicts

## Root Cause

The app has **3 Twilio devices** running simultaneously:
- Broadcast Control: Global device (new)
- Host Dashboard: Global device (new) ‚úÖ
- Screening Room: Local device (old) ‚ùå
- CallNow: Local device (old) ‚ùå

They're fighting over the same Twilio account!

## The Fix (Next Steps)

### Step 1: Update Screening Room
Remove useTwilioCall, use global device from context

### Step 2: Update CallNow
Remove useTwilioCall, use global device from context

### Step 3: Ensure Only ONE Twilio Device
- Initialized in BroadcastContext
- Shared across ALL pages
- Never destroyed until app closes

### Step 4: Route All Audio Through Mixer
- Caller audio ‚Üí Mixer
- Host mic ‚Üí Mixer
- Mixer ‚Üí Output
- Volume controls ‚Üí Mixer gain nodes

## Estimated Time to Complete

- **Screening Room update:** 30 minutes
- **CallNow update:** 15 minutes
- **Testing & debugging:** 1-2 hours
- **Total:** 2-3 hours

## Recommendation

**For Tonight:**
- Deploy what we have
- Test in controlled environment
- Document issues

**For Next Session:**
- Fresh start
- Complete Phase 3 & 4
- Full integration testing
- Polish and production-ready

- ‚úÖ Use Broadcast Control to start/end shows
- ‚úÖ Browse recordings
- ‚úÖ Manage shows with auto-selection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use Audio Hijack for actual mixing (temporarily)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Take calls normally (they work, just not through mixer yet)
