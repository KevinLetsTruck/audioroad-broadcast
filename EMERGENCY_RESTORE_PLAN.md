# Emergency Restore Plan

## Current Situation
We keep trying different commits but none of them have working audio.

## I Need Your Help

**Please tell me:**

1. **What day/time** did you last have EVERYTHING working correctly?
   - Was it today?
   - Yesterday?
   - 2 days ago?
   - Last week?

2. **What were you doing** when it was working?
   - Testing phone calls?
   - Testing WebRTC calls?
   - Both?

3. **What specifically worked?**
   - Screener could hear caller AND caller could hear screener?
   - Host could hear caller AND caller could hear host?
   - Hold music played smoothly (no skipping)?

4. **Do you remember what the greeting sounded like?**
   - Natural AI voice? (means it was after we added AI)
   - Robotic voice? (means it was before)

## My Best Guesses

Based on commit messages, here are possibilities:

### Option A: October 31st Area
- Commit: `ab1ecd4` - "Eliminate beeps by having callers join unmuted"
- Date: Unknown exact time
- Note: Mentioned in comments as "Oct 31 fix"

### Option B: Last Week Sometime  
- Commit: `762f234` - "production ready summary"
- Date: October 20
- Note: Documented as stable

### Option C: Last Month
- Commit: `d10eba1` - "DEPLOYMENT VERIFIED: AudioRoad live"
- Date: Unknown
- Note: Marked as successful deployment

## What I'll Do

**Tell me which timeframe** and I'll find the exact commit from that period and deploy it.

Or if you know a specific thing that was working (like "the caller history panel was there" or "we had the mixer working"), that helps me narrow it down.

I'm sorry for the confusion. Let's get you back to stable ground.
