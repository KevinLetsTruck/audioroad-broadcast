# Fixes Applied - Document & AI Issues

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issues Fixed:** Document holdover bug + Gemini AI 404 errors

---

## 🐛 Issue #1: Document Holdover Bug

### Problem
When screening multiple calls in sequence, documents uploaded by a previous caller would **persist and show up** when picking up a new call. This was confusing and could lead to discussing the wrong person's documents on-air.

### Root Cause
The `DocumentUploadWidget` component was not properly clearing its state when the `callerId` changed. Even though we used `key={activeCall.id}` to force remounting, the internal state wasn't being reset before fetching new documents.

### Solution Applied
Updated `DocumentUploadWidget.tsx` to **immediately clear all state** when `callerId` changes:
- Clear uploaded documents list
- Clear file selection
- Clear document types
- Close any expanded documents
- Only THEN fetch new documents for the new caller

```typescript
// BEFORE
useEffect(() => {
  if (callerId) {
    setUploadedDocs([]);
    fetchExistingDocuments();
  }
}, [callerId]);

// AFTER
useEffect(() => {
  // ALWAYS clear state first to prevent showing old caller's docs
  setUploadedDocs([]);
  setFiles([]);
  setDocumentTypes({});
  setExpandedDoc(null);
  
  if (callerId) {
    console.log('📄 Loading documents for callerId:', callerId);
    fetchExistingDocuments();
  }
}, [callerId]);
```

## 🤖 Issue #2: Gemini AI Analysis Failing

### Problem
When uploading documents, AI analysis would fail with:
```
❌ Gemini API error: [404 Not Found] 
models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta
```

### Root Cause
The Google Generative AI SDK (v0.24.1) uses the v1beta API, which requires specific model names with the `-latest` suffix for stable access.

### Solution Applied
Updated `aiService.ts` to use the correct model name:

```typescript
// BEFORE
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-pro' });

// AFTER
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest' });
```

**Why `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`?**
- ✅ Explicitly compatible with v1beta API
- ✅ Faster response times (good for live broadcasting)
- ✅ Lower cost per request
- ✅ Still excellent quality for document analysis

## ✅ Testing These Fixes

### Test 1: Document Holdover Fix
1. Go to **Screening Room**
2. Have **Caller A** call in and **upload a document** (e.g., "test1.pdf")
3. **Approve** Caller A
4. Have **Caller B** call in (different caller ID)
5. **Pick up** Caller B's call
6. ✅ **VERIFY:** You should see NO documents (or only Caller B's docs if they uploaded any)
7. ❌ **OLD BUG:** Would show Caller A's document incorrectly

### Test 2: AI Analysis Fix
1. Go to **Screening Room**
2. Pick up any call
3. **Upload a document** (PDF, image, etc.)
4. **Wait 5-10 seconds** for AI analysis
5. ✅ **VERIFY:** Document shows "✓ Analyzed" status
6. **Click the document** to expand it
7. ✅ **VERIFY:** You see AI-generated:
   - 📋 Summary
   - 🔍 Key Findings  
   - 💡 Talking Points
   - Confidence score
8. ❌ **OLD BUG:** Would show "AI analysis temporarily unavailable"

## 🔍 What to Look For in Logs

### Successful Document Loading (New Call)
```
📄 No callerId - clearing all documents
📄 Loading documents for callerId: cmgv...
📄 Loaded existing documents: 0
```

### Successful AI Analysis
```
🤖 Calling Gemini API with model: gemini-1.5-flash-latest
✅ Gemini AI response received, length: 342
📝 Cleaned response: {"summary":"...
```

### Previous Errors (Should NOT See These Anymore)
```
❌ Gemini API error: [404 Not Found] models/gemini-pro is not found
```

## 📊 Deployment Status

✅ **Built:** Build succeeded, no errors  
✅ **Committed:** Git commit `4dc7c7d`  
✅ **Pushed:** Deployed to Railway (auto-deploy)  
⏳ **Railway:** Check Railway dashboard for deployment completion

## 🎯 Impact

### Document Holdover Fix
- **Before:** Screener might discuss wrong caller's documents
- **After:** Clean slate for each new call
- **UX:** Less confusion, more professional screening

### AI Analysis Fix
- **Before:** "AI analysis temporarily unavailable" (always)
- **After:** Real AI-powered document analysis
- **Value:** Provides host with instant context and talking points

## 🚀 Next Time You Test

1. **Wait ~2 minutes** for Railway to finish deploying
2. **Hard refresh** the browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Go Live** and start a new episode
4. **Test both scenarios** above
5. **Check Railway logs** if anything seems off

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **React state management:** When using `key` to force remount, also manually clear state in `useEffect` for immediate UI updates
2. **Google AI API:** Model names matter! `-latest` suffix required for v1beta API stability
3. **Production debugging:** Railway logs are your friend - check "Observability" tab, not "Deploy" logs
