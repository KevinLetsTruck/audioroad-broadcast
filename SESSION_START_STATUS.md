## ⚠️ What Needs Work:

### Priority 1: Audio Bridging (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** When screener clicks "Pick Up", form opens but NO audio flows
- Caller can't hear screener
- Screener can't hear caller
- Both are connected but not bridged together

**What's Needed:**
- Twilio Conference must bridge caller + screener
- Web-based Twilio Device needs proper conference joining
- May need to use Twilio Voice SDK differently

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

### Priority 2: Call Lifecycle Management
**Issues:**
- Duplicate call cards (fixed in code, needs testing)
- Rejected calls don't end caller's phone connection
- Calls persist even after they should be gone

**What's Needed:**
- Verify duplicate fix works
- Ensure Reject button ends Twilio call
- Clean up orphaned calls

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

### Priority 3: AI Document Analysis
**Issue:** Gemini API returning 404 errors
- Model name incorrect for API version
- "AI analysis temporarily unavailable" showing

**What's Needed:**
- Research correct model name for @google/generative-ai v0.24.1
- Or upgrade to latest package version
- Test with real documents

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

### Priority 4: Document Persistence
**Issue:** Uploaded files don't reload after page refresh
- Have to re-upload every time
- Fetch endpoint exists but not working

**What's Needed:**
- Debug why fetch isn't loading documents
- Verify callerId is passed correctly
- Test persistence across refreshes

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

1. Go to Screening Room (incognito to avoid cache)
2. Click "🗑️ Clear All (26)" button

- ✅ Complete call screening workflow end-to-end
- ✅ Calls properly cleaned up when done

**Nice to Have:**
- ✅ AI document analysis working

**Stretch Goals:**
- ✅ Multiple screeners can work simultaneously
- ✅ Call queue priority ordering
- ✅ Caller history/notes
