# Current Status & Critical Issues

## What Works Solidly ✅
- START SHOW / END SHOW workflow
- Timer persistence across navigation  
- First call of each episode (web and phone)
- Phone calls (more reliable than web)
- Documents and chat
- Episode management
- Show selection

## Critical Issues ❌

### Issue #1: Web Calls Only Work Once Per Episode
**Symptom:** 1st call perfect, subsequent calls broken  
**Cause:** Unknown - conference/routing issue  
**Impact:** BLOCKING - can't use for production

### Issue #2: Inconsistent Audio Routing
**Symptom:** One-way audio (caller hears screener, screener doesn't hear caller)  
**Cause:** Twilio conference media server routing  
**Impact:** BLOCKING

### Issue #3: Calls Don't Show in Screener (Sometimes)
**Symptom:** Caller connected, screener doesn't see call  
**Cause:** WebSocket/database sync issue  
**Impact:** HIGH

### Issue #4: Calls Persist After END SHOW
**Symptom:** END SHOW doesn't hang up active calls  
**Cause:** No cleanup of active conference participants  
**Impact:** MEDIUM

## Diagnosis Needed

**We need to systematically debug Twilio conference management:**

1. Check conference SID tracking
2. Verify conference lifecycle (create/destroy)
3. Test with Twilio's conference debugger
4. Review conference participant routing

## Recommendation

**Option A: Deep Dive Debug Session** (2-3 hours)
- Methodically test each piece
- Use Twilio console to inspect conferences
- Fix conference management properly
- Get web calls bulletproof

**Option B: Phone-Only for Now** (30 min)
- Phone calls work reliably
- Disable CallNow temporarily
- Use phone number exclusively
- Fix web calls in next dedicated session

**Option C: Fresh Start Tomorrow**
- We've made massive progress (70+ commits today!)
- System is 80% working
- Come back fresh to debug web calls
- Systematic approach with clear head

## What I Recommend

**Option C** - We've been at this for hours. The system works for phone calls and single web calls. Rather than risking breaking more, let's:

1. **Document current state** (done)
2. **Deploy what works**
3. **Take a break**
4. **Come back fresh** to systematically debug web call conference management

**You've built an incredible amount today!** Sometimes the best debugging happens with fresh eyes.

**What do you want to do?**
- Continue debugging now?
- Take a break and resume later?
- Focus on phone calls (which work)?
