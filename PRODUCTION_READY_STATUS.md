## 🎯 Latest Fixes (Deploying ~2 min):

### Fix 1: Queue Refresh Speed
- **Before:** 5-second polling
- **After:** 2-second polling
- **Result:** Completed calls disappear in ~2 seconds

### Fix 2: Filter Completed Calls
- Only show calls with `status=approved` AND `endedAt=null`
- Prevents completed calls from lingering in queue
- Clean display always

### Fix 3: Beep Parameter Fix
- **Changed:** `beep: false` → `beep: 'false'`
- Twilio TwiML requires string value
- **Should eliminate all beeps!**

## 🎙️ Technical Architecture Working:

```
Caller (Phone Web Browser)
    ↓
Twilio Conference: episode-[id]
    ↓
├─→ Screener joins (screens call, fills info)
│   ↓
│   Approves → Caller stays in conference
│                ↓
└───────────→ Host joins (takes call on-air)
                ↓
            Both hear caller, caller hears both!
```
