# Current Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What IS Working:

1. **Web Calling** - You successfully connect, hear the message, get mic access, timer shows
2. **Call button** - Shows correct LIVE/Offline status
3. **File uploads** - Files upload to server (saved in database)
4. **Expandable UI** - Click to expand document analysis

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working:

### 1. AI Analysis Failing
**Error:** `models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta`

**Root Cause:** The @google/generative-ai package v0.24.1 is using the wrong API version or model name format.

**Next Step:** Try simple model names that work with v0.24.1

### 2. Documents Don't Persist  
**Cause:** The fetch endpoint exists but might not be loading correctly

**Next Step:** Check if callerId is being passed correctly, add console logging

### 3. Calls Don't Appear in Screening Room
**Cause:** The /api/twilio/voice endpoint might not be getting the callerId from Twilio's request

**Next Step:** Check Railway Observability logs when making a call to see what Twilio actually sends

## üéØ Priority Fix Order:

1. **FIRST: Get calls showing in Screening Room** (most important for your use case)
2. **SECOND: Fix Gemini AI** (document analysis)
3. **THIRD: Document persistence** (nice to have)

## üîç What We Need:

**Railway Observability Logs** when you make a call. This will show:
- What parameters Twilio sends to /api/twilio/voice
- Whether the call record is created
- Whether WebSocket event is emitted

Without these logs, I'm fixing blind.
