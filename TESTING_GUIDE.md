## Common Issues to Watch For

### ‚ùå If Timer Stuck at 00:00:00
**Check:** Browser console for timer logs
**Fix:** Refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)

### ‚ùå If Mic Shows Disconnected (but works)
**Check:** Browser console - look for "Added audio source: Host Microphone"
**Note:** This is a display issue, audio still works

### ‚ùå If Volume Sliders Don't Work
**Check:** Console for "[CALL] Adding to mixer"
**Fix:** Make sure you started show from Broadcast Control first

### ‚ùå If Navigation Disconnects Call
**Check:** Console for "Twilio Device" cleanup messages
**Fix:** This means old code is cached - hard refresh

### ‚ùå If Calls Drop Randomly
**Check:** Multiple "Twilio Device ready" messages
**Fix:** Only ONE device should initialize
