# üîÑ Clerk Migration Guide - Step by Step

## What We're Doing

Replacing our custom-built authentication with Clerk's enterprise-grade system.

---

## Phase 1: Setup ‚úÖ (You're doing this now)

1. Create Clerk account
2. Create application
3. Get API keys
4. Share keys with me

---

## Phase 2: Configuration (I'll do this)

### What I'll Change:

1. **Add Environment Variables**
   - `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

2. **Wrap App with Clerk Provider**
   - Replace our AuthProvider with ClerkProvider
   - Add Clerk components

3. **Update Routes**
   - Replace our Login page with Clerk's SignIn
   - Add Clerk's user management

---

## Phase 3: Replace Authentication (I'll do this)

### Frontend Changes:

**Before (Our DIY):**
```typescript
// Custom login page
<Login />

// Custom auth context
const { user } = useAuth();

// Custom protected routes
<ProtectedRoute>...</ProtectedRoute>
```

**After (Clerk):**
```typescript
// Clerk's beautiful sign-in
<SignIn />

// Clerk's hook
const { user } = useUser();

// Clerk's protected routes
<SignedIn>...</SignedIn>
```

### Backend Changes:

**Before:**
```typescript
// Our middleware
requireAuth(req, res, next)

// Our JWT verification
verifyToken(token)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Clerk's middleware
clerkClient.verifyToken(token)

// Automatic user info
req.auth.userId
```

---

## Phase 4: Role Management (I'll configure)

### Clerk Metadata

We'll use Clerk's metadata system for roles:

```typescript
// Host user
{
  publicMetadata: {
    role: "host",
    showId: "show_123"
  }
}

// Screener user
{
  publicMetadata: {
    role: "screener"
  }
}
```

This replaces our BroadcastUser table for auth!

---

## Phase 5: Migration Strategy

### User Data

**Option A: Fresh Start (Recommended)**
- Start with clean Clerk users
- Create new admin in Clerk
- Invite team members
- They sign up with Clerk

**Option B: Migrate Existing Users**
- Export from our database
- Import to Clerk via API
- Users reset passwords
- More complex

**I recommend Option A** - you only have 1 admin user right now.

---

## Phase 6: Testing Plan

### What We'll Test:

1. ‚úÖ Sign in with email/password
2. ‚úÖ Sign in with Google
3. ‚úÖ Sign up new user
4. ‚úÖ Password reset
5. ‚úÖ Role-based access (host vs screener)
6. ‚úÖ User profile
7. ‚úÖ Sign out
8. ‚úÖ Multiple tabs (session management)

---

## Phase 7: Cleanup (I'll do)

### Files to Remove:
- `server/services/authService.ts` (replaced by Clerk)
- `server/routes/auth.ts` (replaced by Clerk)
- `server/middleware/auth.ts` (replaced by Clerk)
- `src/pages/Login.tsx` (replaced by Clerk components)
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (replaced by Clerk)
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` (replaced by Clerk)

### Files to Keep:
- Everything else!
- Your entire app stays the same
- Just auth layer changes

---

## What You Get

### Before (DIY):
- ‚ùå Basic email/password only
- ‚ùå No social logins
- ‚ùå No password reset
- ‚ùå No email verification
- ‚ùå Manual user management (database queries)
- ‚ùå You maintain security

### After (Clerk):
- ‚úÖ Email/password + social logins
- ‚úÖ Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc.
- ‚úÖ Built-in password reset
- ‚úÖ Email verification
- ‚úÖ Beautiful admin dashboard
- ‚úÖ Clerk maintains security
- ‚úÖ MFA/2FA ready
- ‚úÖ User profiles

**Total Time:** 4-6 hours

1. **Setup Clerk:** 5 min (you)
2. **Install & Configure:** 30 min (me)
3. **Replace Auth Components:** 2 hours (me)
4. **Set Up Roles:** 30 min (me)
5. **Test Everything:** 30 min (us)
6. **Clean Up Old Code:** 30 min (me)
7. **Documentation:** 30 min (me)

## Cost

**Clerk Pricing:**
- Free: 10,000 monthly active users
- Pro: $25/month (if you need more)

**Your Scale:**
- Beta: ~10-50 users (FREE)
- Launch: ~100-500 users (FREE)
- Growth: ~1,000-5,000 users (FREE)
- Success: 10,000+ users ($25/month - happy problem!)

## Safety

**Can We Roll Back?**
Yes! I'm not deleting any code until we've tested Clerk thoroughly.

**Migration Steps:**
1. Install Clerk (parallel to existing auth)
2. Test Clerk
3. Switch to Clerk
4. Test again
5. Only then remove old code

**Worst Case:**
If something goes wrong, we can switch back to DIY auth in 5 minutes.

## Next Steps (After You Provide Keys)

1. I'll add keys to `.env`
2. Configure Clerk in your app
3. Replace login page
4. Set up role management
5. Test everything
6. You'll see beautiful auth! üéâ

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Will this break my app?**
A: No! We're only replacing auth. Everything else stays the same.

**Q: What about my current database?**
A: Stays! We just won't use BroadcastUser for auth anymore.

**Q: Can users still have roles?**
A: Yes! Clerk has metadata for roles (host, screener, admin).

**Q: What about the calls, episodes, shows?**
A: Unchanged! All your business logic stays exactly the same.

**Q: Is Clerk secure?**
A: MORE secure than our DIY. SOC 2 compliant, used by thousands of companies.

**Q: Can I customize the look?**
A: Yes! Full control over colors, logos, branding.
