## üéØ To Go Live with Your First Show

### Step 1: Test WebRTC Calls (This Week)

**Already have**:

- ‚úÖ Twilio Auth Token
- ‚úÖ Twilio API Key & Secret
- ‚úÖ Twilio TwiML App SID
- ‚úÖ Phone Number: +1 (888) 804-9791

**To test**:

2. Open Screening Room in one browser tab
3. Open Call Now in another tab/device
4. Click "Call Now" button
5. Should connect via WebRTC!

**If it doesn't work immediately**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify microphone permissions
- Twilio Voice SDK might need browser-specific setup

### Step 2: Get Claude AI (Optional - For Document Analysis)

1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com
2. Sign up for account
3. Create API key
4. Add to `.env` as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
5. Restart backend

**Then document analysis will work:**
- Caller uploads CGM data

### Step 3: Set Up AWS S3 (Optional - For Recordings)

1. Create AWS account
2. Create S3 bucket: `audioroad-recordings`
3. Get Access Key ID and Secret
4. Add to `.env`
5. Restart backend

**Then recordings will save:**
- Individual call recordings
- Full episode recordings
- Document storage

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

**Push to GitHub**:
```bash
cd /Users/kr/Development/audioroad-broadcast
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/audioroad-broadcast.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Deploy to Railway**:
1. Go to railway.app
2. New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub
3. Select `audioroad-broadcast` repo
4. Add all environment variables from `.env`
5. Change `APP_URL` to your Railway URL
6. Deploy!

**Configure Twilio for Production**:
1. Update TwiML App voice URL to: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/twilio/incoming-call`
2. Update phone number webhook
