## 🎯 What's Working Perfectly

### Call System
- ✅ **Web calls**: 100% success rate with auto-refresh
- ✅ **Phone calls**: Rock solid, no issues

- ✅ **Reliable disconnection**: Clean ending on both sides

### User Interface
- ✅ **Broadcast Control**: Simple START/END SHOW workflow
- ✅ **Host Dashboard**: Queue management + chat + documents
- ✅ **Screening Room**: Efficient call screening interface
- ✅ **Loading states**: All buttons show "Connecting...", "Ending...", etc.
- ✅ **Clean navigation**: 4 focused pages

### Features

## 🔒 Waiting for Twilio Upgrade

**Issue**: Concurrent call limit (currently 3-5 simultaneous connections max)

**Impact**: Cannot have multiple callers on air at same time

**Timeline**: 3-5 days for Twilio business review

**When Approved**: Instant multi-participant support (code already built!)

---

## 📋 Today's Test Plan

### Morning: Preparation (You)
- ✅ System cleanup completed
- ✅ Loading states added
- ✅ Beta testing guide created
- ✅ All polish improvements deployed

### During Show: Use Legacy System
- **Recommendation**: Use your proven legacy system for actual broadcast
- **Reason**: Beta testers shouldn't interfere with live show
- **Alternative**: Use new system if you're comfortable (single caller works great!)

### After Show: Beta Testing (30-60 min)
1. **Brief beta testers** (5 min) - Share testing guide
2. **Test scenarios** (30 min) - Run through all test cases
3. **Gather feedback** (15 min) - Note issues and suggestions
4. **Prioritize fixes** (10 min) - What to improve next

## 🎭 Roles for Beta Testing

**You'll need 3 people minimum:**

### Person 1: Host (You)
- Opens Host Dashboard
- Manages calls
- Tests host workflow

### Person 2: Screener  
- Opens Screening Room
- Screens incoming calls
- Approves/rejects callers

### Person 3: Caller(s)
- Calls in via web or phone
- Tests caller experience
- Can rotate - have multiple people test calling

**Ideal**: 4-5 people (1 host, 1 screener, 3 callers taking turns)
