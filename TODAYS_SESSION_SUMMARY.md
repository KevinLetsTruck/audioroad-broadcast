## 📊 Technical Architecture:

```
Caller (Web Browser)
    ↓
Twilio Device.connect()
    ↓
/api/twilio/voice endpoint
    ↓
Creates Call record in database
    ↓
Twilio Conference: episode-[id]
    ↓
Caller waits (hold music)
    
Screener clicks "Pick Up"
    ↓
Screener Twilio Device.connect(role: screener)
    ↓
Joins same conference
    ↓
startConferenceOnEnter: true (conference starts!)
    ↓
Audio flows: Caller ↔ Screener
    ↓
Screener approves
    ↓
Call status: approved

Host clicks "Take Call On-Air"
    ↓
Host Twilio Device.connect(role: host)
    ↓
Joins same conference
    ↓
Audio flows: Caller ↔ Host
    ↓
Host ends call
    ↓
Twilio.endCall(CallSid)
    ↓
Caller phone hangs up
```
