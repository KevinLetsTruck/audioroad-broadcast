## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing Clerk Publishable Key"

**Solution:** Make sure `.env` file has:
```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_cmVhZHktZG92ZS02NC5jbGVyay5hY2NvdW50cy5kZXYk
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_aTul5B4ldsXsIB76IbdM1OaXAvcJt1xHzCbWe7O6p4
```

### "Access Denied" after sign-in

**Solution:** Assign a role in Clerk dashboard (see "Setting Up User Roles" above)

### Social login doesn't work

**Solution:** 
- Development: Should work automatically
- Production: Need to configure OAuth apps (Clerk guides you)

### Webhook not receiving events

**Solution:**
1. In Clerk dashboard, go to "Webhooks"
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/clerk/webhooks`
3. Select events: user.created, user.updated, user.deleted
4. Add webhook secret to .env: `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx`
