# üîß Maintenance Guide

## What We Built Today (Summary)

You went from a complex multi-step broadcast process to a **ONE-BUTTON system** that:
- ‚úÖ Replaces Audio Hijack completely
- ‚úÖ Has individual volume control for every participant
- ‚úÖ Auto-detects which show to broadcast
- ‚úÖ Auto-uploads recordings to S3
- ‚úÖ Has organized recordings library
- ‚úÖ Works across proper URLs

**Total changes:** ~5,000 lines of code across 20+ files!

---

## üö® Critical Maintenance (Do Now)

### 1. Enable Broadcast Routes in Production

**What:** The broadcast API routes are disabled because we haven't run database migration.

**Fix:**
1. Run the migration SQL in Railway's database console
2. Or use the Prisma command (when database is accessible)

**SQL to run:** See `MANUAL_MIGRATION.sql` file

**Once done:**
In `server/index.ts`, uncomment these lines:
```typescript
import broadcastRoutes from './routes/broadcast.js';
app.use('/api/broadcast', apiLimiter, broadcastRoutes);
```

### 2. Seed Your 5 Shows in Production

**What:** Create the 5 weekly shows in your production database.

**How:** Visit this URL once:
```
https://audioroad-broadcast-production.up.railway.app/api/shows/seed
```

**Verify:** Go to Broadcast Control and see show auto-selected!

### 3. Clear Browser Cache

**Why:** You've had issues with old code being cached.

**How:**
1. Open your production app
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
3. Or: DevTools ‚Üí Right-click refresh ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Do this on all browsers/devices you use!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Maintenance (Do Soon)

### 4. Test Complete Broadcast Workflow

**Test this end-to-end:**
1. ‚úÖ Click "START SHOW"
2. ‚úÖ Make a test call
3. ‚úÖ Adjust caller volume
4. ‚úÖ Switch to Host Dashboard (verify mixer keeps running!)
5. ‚úÖ Switch back to Broadcast Control
6. ‚úÖ Click "END SHOW"
7. ‚úÖ Check recording uploaded to S3
8. ‚úÖ View in Recordings page

**If anything breaks, let me know!**

### 5. Configure S3 for Recordings

**Check Railway environment variables:**
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Your AWS key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Your AWS secret
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME` - Bucket for recordings (e.g., `audioroad-recordings`)
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)

**Create S3 bucket** (if doesn't exist):
1. AWS Console ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Create Bucket
2. Name: `audioroad-recordings`
3. Region: Same as your other resources
4. Enable public access (or use signed URLs)

### 6. Check Railway Deployment Logs

**What to look for:**
- ‚úÖ "Server running on port 8080"
- ‚úÖ "Stream socket handlers initialized"
- ‚ùå Any crash errors
- ‚ùå Database connection errors

**Where:** Railway dashboard ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Logs tab

### 7. Update Radio.co Settings

**In Broadcast Control:**
1. Click ‚öôÔ∏è Settings
2. Enter your Radio.co password
3. Save settings

**Note:** Settings save in browser localStorage (not database yet since migration pending)

---

## üí° Optional Maintenance (When You Have Time)

### 8. Clean Up Unused Files

**Files you might not need anymore:**
- `src/components/AudioMixer.tsx` - Old mixer (replaced by BroadcastMixer)
- `src/components/BroadcastMixer.tsx` - Not used now (controls in BroadcastControl)

**Don't delete yet** - keep as backup until system is tested!

### 9. Run Security Audit

**Check for vulnerabilities:**
```bash
npm audit
```

**Fix moderate issues:**
```bash
npm audit fix
```

**Current status:** 2 moderate vulnerabilities (non-critical)

### 10. Optimize Bundle Size

**Current:** 944 KB (large!)

**Could optimize by:**
- Code splitting (lazy load pages)
- Remove unused dependencies
- Tree shaking improvements

**Not urgent** - works fine for now, optimize later if needed

### 11. Add Error Monitoring

**Consider adding:**
- Sentry for error tracking
- LogRocket for session replay
- Custom error logging endpoint

**When:** After you're comfortable with the system

## üìã Daily Maintenance (Ongoing)

### Before Each Show

**Quick checks:**
1. ‚úÖ Hard refresh browser (clear cache)
2. ‚úÖ Test microphone in Broadcast Control
3. ‚úÖ Verify correct show auto-selected
4. ‚úÖ Check Radio.co password entered

**Time:** 30 seconds

### After Each Show

**What happens automatically:**
1. ‚úÖ Recording uploads to S3
2. ‚úÖ Episode marked as completed
3. ‚úÖ Mixer cleans up

**You should:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify recording in Recordings page
2. ‚úÖ Check it's the right show name

**Time:** 10 seconds

### Weekly Maintenance

**Every week:**
1. ‚úÖ Check Railway logs for errors
2. ‚úÖ Verify all recordings uploaded correctly
3. ‚úÖ Hard refresh browser
4. ‚úÖ Test a quick broadcast (30 seconds)

**Time:** 5 minutes

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Mixer disconnected when I switched pages"
**Before fix:** This was a bug  
**After fix:** Mixer now persists!  
**If still happening:** Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)

### "Wrong show selected"
**Fix:** Click the ‚Üª button to change shows manually

### "Recording didn't upload to S3"
**Check:**
1. S3 environment variables in Railway
2. Browser console for upload errors
3. Recording should download locally as fallback

### "No audio on calls"
**Fix:** Hard refresh browser (old code cached)

### "START SHOW button doesn't work"
**Check:**
1. Is a show selected?
2. Browser console for errors
3. Railway backend running?

## üìä Files to Monitor

### Important Files (Check Occasionally)

**Backend:**
- `server/index.ts` - Main server (check it starts)
- `server/services/radioCoStreamService.ts` - Radio.co connection
- `server/routes/recordings.ts` - S3 uploads

**Frontend:**
- `src/pages/BroadcastControl.tsx` - Main broadcast page
- `src/services/audioMixerEngine.ts` - Mixer logic
- `src/contexts/BroadcastContext.tsx` - Shared state

### Log Files

**Check these in Railway:**
- Server startup logs
- API error logs
- WebSocket connection logs
- Database query logs

---

## üéØ Quick Maintenance Commands

## üöÄ Recommended: Do These 3 Things Now

**1. Seed shows** (30 seconds)
```
Visit: https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/shows/seed
```

**2. Hard refresh** (5 seconds)
```
Press: Cmd + Shift + R on your production app
```

**3. Test workflow** (2 minutes)
```
