Each source has independent volume (GainNode)
```

### Individual Volume Control
```typescript
// When you move a slider:
mixerEngine.setVolume('caller-123', 75);

// Internally:
source.gainNode.gain.value = 0.75; // Only affects this caller!

// Other sources unchanged:
hostGain.value = 0.80  // Still 80%
caller2Gain.value = 0.90  // Still 90%
```

## 🎮 User Interface

### Mixer Tab in Host Dashboard

## 🎓 For Beginners

Since you mentioned you have no coding experience, here's what to know:

### What Was Built
Think of it like this:
1. **audioMixerEngine.ts** = The brain (does the actual mixing)
2. **BroadcastMixer.tsx** = The control panel (what you see and click)
3. **VUMeter.tsx** = The level meters (shows if audio is good)
4. **streamEncoder.ts** = The transmitter (sends to Radio.co)

### How to Use It
1. Click buttons in the UI
2. Move sliders to adjust volume
3. Watch the meters to see levels
4. That's it! The code handles everything else

### When Things Go Wrong
1. Check the Quick Reference guide
2. Try the User Guide for detailed help
3. The console (F12) might show errors
4. Refresh the page and try again
