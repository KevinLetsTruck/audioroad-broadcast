# Final Testing Plan - After Railway Deploys

## ✅ What's Working NOW:

1. **Call button shows correct status** - "🔴 LIVE NOW" 
2. **Live status syncing** - Polls every 10 seconds
3. **File uploads work** - Files appear in list
4. **Expandable document viewer** - Click to see analysis
5. **Caller ID auto-creation** - Created on page load
6. **Web calling connects!** - Mic access working
7. **Call accepted message** - "✅ Call accepted - connected!"
8. **Console is cleaner** - Device loop fixed

## ⏳ What's Deploying (Wait 2-3 minutes):

1. **Screening Room integration** - Calls should appear in queue
2. **Improved AI logging** - See why Gemini is failing
3. **Debug logging for calls** - Railway logs will show what Twilio sends

## 🧪 Test Plan After Deployment:

### Test 1: Check Railway Logs for Call Flow
1. Go to Railway → Deployments → View logs
2. Make sure latest deployment is Active
3. Try calling from web
4. Look for these logs in Railway:
   ```
   📞 Voice endpoint called with body: {...}
   📞 Extracted - callerId: ... CallSid: ...
   ✅ Call record created: ...
   📡 Notified screening room
   ```
5. **Send me screenshot of these logs!**

### Test 2: Upload Document & Check AI
1. Upload a new document
2. Check Railway logs for:
   ```
   ✅ Gemini AI response received, length: ...
   📝 Cleaned response: {...}
   ```
   OR
   ```
   ❌ Gemini API error: [error details]
   ```
3. **Send me the Railway logs showing upload + AI analysis**

### Test 3: Call Should Appear in Screening Room
1. Keep Screening Room open
2. Make a call from Call Now page
3. Call should appear in "Calls in Queue" (currently shows 0)
4. Screener should be able to approve/reject

## 🎯 Current Issues to Debug:

### Issue 1: Calls Not Appearing in Screening Room
**Status:** Deploying fix now  
**Debug:** Railway logs will show if WebSocket event is sent  
**Test:** Call again after deployment

### Issue 2: AI Shows "Temporarily Unavailable"
**Status:** Deploying better logging  
**Debug:** Railway logs will show exact Gemini error  
**Test:** Upload new file after deployment

## 📊 Next Steps:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Railway to deploy
2. **Test calling** and check Railway logs
3. **Upload a file** and check Railway logs
4. **Send me both sets of Railway logs**
5. I'll fix any remaining issues!
