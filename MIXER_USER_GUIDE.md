# Audio Mixer User Guide

2. Your browser will ask for microphone permission - click **"Allow"**

### Step 3: Connect Your Microphone

1. Once initialized, click **"Connect Mic"**
2. Your microphone will appear as the first channel in the mixer
3. You'll see a VU meter (volume indicator) showing your mic level

## Using the Mixer

### Understanding the Interface

Each audio source gets its own **mixer channel** with:
- **üé§ Icon** - Shows what type of source it is (mic, caller, soundboard)
- **Volume Slider** - Adjust from 0-100%
- **Mute Button** - Instantly mute/unmute this source
- **VU Meter** - Visual indicator of audio level (green = good, yellow = loud, red = too loud)

### Audio Sources

1. **Host Microphone** üé§
   - Your main mic input
   - Default volume: 80%
   - Appears immediately when you connect your mic

2. **Callers** üìû
   - Each caller gets their own channel automatically
   - Shows caller name
   - Appears when you take a call
   - Disappears when call ends
   - Default volume: 75%

3. **Soundboard** üéµ (Coming soon)

## Tips for Best Sound Quality

### Volume Levels (VU Meters)

- **Green** = Perfect! This is where you want to be
- **Yellow** = Getting loud, but still okay
- **Red** = Too loud! Turn it down to avoid distortion

### Recommended Settings

- **Host Mic**: 70-80%
- **Callers**: 70-80%
- **Master Output**: 90-100%

### Avoid These Common Issues

1. **Feedback/Echo**
   - Use headphones when mixing
   - Don't have your own stream playing in the background
   
2. **Distorted Audio**
   - If VU meters are in the red, lower volumes
   - Start with all sources at 75% and adjust from there

3. **One Source Too Quiet**
   - Boost just that channel's volume
   - Don't raise master volume (affects everything)

## Individual Volume Control

Each source has **independent volume control**! This means:

‚úÖ **You can**: Turn up a quiet caller without affecting your mic
‚úÖ **You can**: Lower your mic during a caller's story
‚úÖ **You can**: Adjust soundboard volume separately

This gives you **full mixing power** like a professional broadcast console!

## Troubleshooting

### "Microphone Access Denied"

1. Your browser blocked mic access
2. Click the üîí lock icon in your browser's address bar
3. Allow microphone access

### "No Audio from Caller"

1. Check if caller's channel is muted (red mute button)
