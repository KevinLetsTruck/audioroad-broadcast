## 💰 COST ESTIMATE

- **Twilio**: ~$20-30/month (based on 3 hours/day × 4 days)
- **Railway Database**: Already included in your plan
- **Claude AI**: ~$10-20/month (when you add it)
- **AWS S3**: ~$1-5/month (when you add it)
- **Total**: ~$35-60/month

Much cheaper than traditional broadcast software ($100-500/month)!
